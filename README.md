# Ceasar Cipher

This project was a personal project that was made in the third year of my bachelor's program at Hashemite University.

In which, I decided to make a website that encrypts cyphers.
Also, it will contain the following features:
 - Browse File
 - Allow symbols or not
 - introduce spaces in the cypher text or not


Attacehed you will find the website:
